# memeify
App for creating Memes.

From source code of this project you will learn following things in Android:
1) Intent
2) How to access camera, capture image, modify image and save image to gallery
3) While sharing image from any app, this app also appears in suggested apps
4) Bitmap

I have learnt all this from [Raywenderlich](https://www.raywenderlich.com/4700198-android-intents-tutorial-with-kotlin) website.
